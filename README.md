        <strong>About me</strong><br>
        Hello, my name is Alexey Ovsyanik, and I'm currently studying at Nottingham Trent University.
         I speak English and Russian, and I am learning German. My hobbies include equestrianism, fencing, painting 
         miniatures, wargaming, collaborative roleplaying, and I enjoy learning more interesting facts
         about history, dinosaurs, and collecting medieval weapons and armour.My course in Nottigham Trent university is data 
         science . I chose this course becaue i am intrested in data scince as i enjoy math and solving problems, and i thought
         that data scince would be a good fit for me . I dont see myself in any other field, so i will do what ever it take to suceed in these feild.
