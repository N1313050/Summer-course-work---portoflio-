    <h1>Reflections on Career Aspirations</h1>
    
<p>I haven't made any evident progress toward a particular data science career at this point in my academic career. But through extracurricular and educational pursuits, I've started to learn more about the field. I've developed an interest in data-driven roles as a result of my exposure to industry workshops and guest lectures, which have given me a general understanding of the range of data science and technology opportunities.</p>

<p>I have built a foundation in several key areas during my time at university. I learned how to use SPSS Statistics to analyse real-world datasets in the Fundamentals of Data Science course. I was able to develop my fundamental skills in data analysis, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and ANOVA thanks to this practical experience. Additionally, I improved my ability to reason analytically, particularly when analysing results to make defensible choices. Even though I haven't had much experience with tools like Python, this course made me recognise how useful statistical software is for deciphering complex data.</p>

<p>I first encountered Python in the course Programming for Data Science. It was difficult at first, but I eventually gained confidence in my ability to use NumPy and pandas to perform fundamental data analysis and manipulation. Even though I'm still learning Python, this course gave me a strong foundation and motivated me to improve my skills. I recognise the importance of programming in the data science field and the need to consciously develop this skill in the future.</p>
