    <h1>Reflections on Career Aspirations</h1>
    
<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have grown interested in data science, one of today's most in-demand professions. As Anuj Khandelwal notes in his article about the nine fastest-growing jobs, roles in data science are increasingly vital. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, their relevance will only continue to grow. My exposure to industry workshops, guest lectures, and coursework has allowed me to explore the field more deeply and build a solid foundation..</p>

<p>During my first year at university, I began to acquire core data science competencies. I used SPSS Statistics to analyse real-world datasets in the Fundamentals of Data Science module. This hands-on experience taught me key analytical methods such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and ANOVA. It also sharpened my critical thinking and helped me understand how data-driven decisions are made. Although I have limited experience with programming tools, this course made me appreciate the value of statistical software in making sense of complex datasets.</p>

<p>My first formal experience with Python came through the Programming for Data Science course. Initially, I found the learning curve steep, but I gained confidence using libraries like NumPy and pandas to perform fundamental data analysis and manipulation over time. This course provided a strong foundation in programming and helped me realise how essential these skills are in any data science role. I am motivated to continue strengthening my coding skills to match the demands of the field.</p>
<p>At the beginning of term 2, I had initial problems with the Systems Analysis and Design module. However, I took the initiative to study the content independently, gaining a sound theoretical understanding of requirements analysis, project planning, system architecture, user interface design, and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). While I still lack practical experience in these areas, I plan to build on this foundation through future hands-on learning. Outside the classroom, I have looked for more growth opportunities. I began learning German to improve my communication skills and prepare for possible international collaboration. I also learned about web development and how data informs project planning and evaluation, particularly through professional development modules tailored for industry applications.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I aim to apply the knowledge and skills acquired in university through a structured internship during my degree. Working on real data science projects under the guidance of experienced professionals will allow me to apply theory to practice and further develop my technical and collaborative skills. I intend to pursue further training opportunities to broaden my skill set—particularly in data visualisation, machine learning, and advanced programming—and to participate in industry events, workshops, and conferences to stay connected with evolving trends and techniques. </p>
<p>As British mathematician Clive Humby famously stated, “data is the new oil”. I firmly believe in the power of data and its ability to provide insights that lead to innovation and thoughtful decision-making. My long-term goal is to become a senior data analyst in five years. To reach this goal, I will keep pursuing hands-on experiences that fit my academic training and enable me to make a meaningful impact on real-world data challenges.</p>
