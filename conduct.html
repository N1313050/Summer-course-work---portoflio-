    <h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
    


    <p>Throughout this module, my understanding of professionalism—particularly about the BCS Code of Conduct—has developed significantly. Although I haven't yet worked in the IT industry, the academic setting has offered several opportunities to apply professional values in practice, particularly in terms of responsibility, respect, and integrity.
The one area where I made an effort to remain professional was in the group project. I tried not to use the conflict of teamwork, which can result in uneven participation, but actively engaged with our project, spoke freely and listened to other perspectives . Not so, I saw it as an opportunity to restrain practices and habits of collaboration, a cornerstone in the BCS Code.</p>

    <p>What's more, after writing the final report of this module, I shall deliberately adopt ethical academic attitudes. This encompasses doing the necessary research properly, citing sources duly, and avoiding any shortcuts. This seems a mere trifle, yet I feel it reflects a commitment to honour and professional standards that will be equally important in the workplace. </p>

    <p>One of the most unexpected lessons came from building the site and presenting my work. I was not sure about coding at first, so I spent a whole week learning the basics to ensure that everything about this site worked properly and met with accessibility standards.
That said, I know there’s still a gap between understanding professional conduct and applying it consistently. Academic settings offer a controlled environment, but the real test will occur in more dynamic workplace situations--especially when under pressure or faced with ethical greys. Moving forward, I hope to keep developing not just my technical skills but also my professional judgement and resilience.</p>
