    <h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
    
<p>This page covers professional behaviour, ethics, and lessons learned during academic and personal development relevant to future workplace expectations.</p>

    <p>What we have covered in class, especially the BCS Code of Conduct, has greatly influenced how I view professional conduct. I now recognise the value of honesty, responsibility, and decency toward others in the workplace, particularly when considering the potential effects of our actions on clients, coworkers, and the general public.</p>

    <p>I've begun to think more carefully about how these ideas apply to my behaviour, even though the majority of my awareness stems from scholarly discussions rather than practical experience. For instance, I was aware that I still had to make up lost time when I was unable to attend a portion of the System Analysis and Design course because of health concerns. I took the initiative to study the material on my own, not only to complete the course requirements but also because I believed it was important to practice personal accountability, which is something the Code emphasises a lot.</p>

    <p>In a similar vein, I strive to respect diverse opinions and make a positive contribution in group situations and workshops, keeping in mind that professionalism influences team trust and success. Nevertheless, I am aware that there is still a disconnect between my theoretical understanding of professionalism and my consistent application of it in the workplace. As I continue to grow, I'm trying to close that gap.</p>
