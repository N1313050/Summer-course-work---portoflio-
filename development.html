    <h1>Knowledge and Skills Development</h1>
    

    <p>My development plan lists short and long-term activities in order to address needs I identified for myself, although there are still a few gaps regarding scope and planning.</p>

    <p>In the immediate term, I've been able to demonstrate some of what my various professionalism teachings—particularly from the BCS Code of Conduct—by being more honest in coursework and group work. For example, I independently brought myself up-to-speed with missed material from Systems Analysis & Design after health difficulties.</p>

    <p>I have also started working on my academic writing and begun tailoring it to better represent what I want for myself in terms of employment. However, I still need to improve, as my writing lacks a personal touch and clear links to specific roles.So in the coming month i plan to write more so i can fully develop these skill, i will look into joining the student news sapper to imprve that skill </p>

    <p>Outside of class, I continue to learn German to improve communication skills, and I have defined specific goals  milestones i wish to achive . I plan to continue building my Python skills and start working with Matplotlib and scikit-learn to close gaps in data visualisation and machine learning knowledge.</p>

    <p>While i have laid out a plan for my career and how i will achive it, i have yet to begin to year 2 , and who know in which areas of that course i may strugle in so currently im looking in on what the course may entail , and how i may get ahead of it </p>
