        <strong>About me</strong><br>
        Hello, my name is Alexey Ovsyanik, and I'm currently studying at Nottingham Trent University.
         I speak English and Russian, and I am learning German. My hobbies include equestrianism, fencing, painting 
         miniatures, wargaming, collaborative roleplaying, and I enjoy learning more interesting facts
         about history, dinosaurs, and collecting medieval weapons and armour. But my favourite hobby, specifically
         wargaming, and going into even more specifics- The Warhammer 40k tabletop, I have been a fan
         of that franchise for over 4 years already, I have read countless books to deepen my understanding of
         the setting, and in the wargaming community has given me a lot of new friends, who I talk to to these days.
