    <h1>Analysis and Evidence of Skills</h1>
    
<p>This section will include analysis and evidence of Alexey's key skills, including communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and time management.</p>

    <p>During this year at university I have developed the following skill set.</p>

    <p>In Fundamentals of Data Science, I have learned and mastered how to use SPSS Statistics. I have a strong background in data analysis and statistical reasoning. During this course, I conducted hands-on analysis using SPSS and worked with real-world datasets. I developed foundational knowledge in probability theory, sampling designs, and descriptive statistics. I also learned to carry out hypothesis tests, simple linear regression, and ANOVA, which allowed me to draw conclusions from data and make informed decisions.</p>

    <p>Each of these skills was supported by practical exercises using real datasets, helping me build both technical and analytical skills. I am now confident in my ability to engage with data-related problems and communicate my findings clearly and effectively.</p>

    <p>For the System Analysis and Design course, I couldn't attend the first part of the second term due to health issues. However, I took the opportunity to study the material independently. I learned about SDLC approaches, project planning, requirements analysis, functional and structural modeling, data and architectural design, user interface and program design. Though I missed the practical component, this independent study gave me a solid theoretical foundation and increased my confidence in applying system development concepts in practice.</p>

    <p>Programming for Data Science was my first exposure to Python, so it took time to get comfortable. As I progressed, I built a basic understanding of Python’s structure and its use in data science. I worked with libraries like NumPy and pandas to explore, clean, and manipulate data. Through practice, I gained a better grasp of how coding supports the data analysis process. I went from zero Python experience to being able to complete basic data tasks independently.</p>

    <p>As for the Professional Development for Industry module, I learned the basics of the web development process and how data analysis supports project planning and evaluation.</p>
